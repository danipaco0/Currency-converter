This project features a simple web application built with Flask, allowing users to convert currency amounts from one currency to another. 
The application utilizes the Flask framework for web development and integrates the Plotly library to provide historical exchange rate data visualization. 
It interacts with an external currency exchange rate API to retrieve real-time exchange rate information. Users can input the amount, 
select source and target currencies, and view the currency conversion result alongside a historical exchange rate trend chart.

**The application runs on the local server and uses the currencyapi.com API.**

**NOTE:** For the historical exchange rates, a paid API plan is needed.
